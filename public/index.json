[{"content":"Who Am I? Hey there! I\u0026rsquo;m a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) based in New York, deeply passionate about Kubernetes, DevOps, and Cloud Computing.\nMy Journey I started my career as a Linux enthusiast, tinkering with servers, optimizing infrastructure, and automating everything I could. Over time, I delved into Kubernetes, Terraform, and cloud platforms like AWS, refining my skills in container orchestration, automation, and infrastructure as code.\nToday, I specialize in Kubernetes, networking, and Linux internals, aiming to contribute to open-source projects and become a recognized expert in the field. My goal? To bridge the gap between complex infrastructure and developer experience, making cloud-native technologies more accessible.\nWhy This Blog? I created KubeOrNotToBe to share insights, best practices, and real-world experiences from the trenches. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s debugging Kubernetes issues, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, or exploring new DevOps tools, you\u0026rsquo;ll find practical content here.\nSome topics I love to cover:\nKubernetes deep dives (controllers, operators, networking, and security) Cloud-native tooling (Helm, Terraform, Ansible) SRE methodologies (incident management, observability, and chaos engineering) DevOps automation (GitOps, CI/CD, and IaC) Hacking and security (CKS preparation, securing clusters, pentesting cloud environments) What‚Äôs Next? üöÄ I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on:\nCreating a Helm chart to deploy applications with best practices Building a Kubernetes operator to automate configuration updates Developing training materials for CKA, CKS, and Terraform certifications Growing my presence on LinkedIn \u0026amp; YouTube to share tech insights Let‚Äôs Connect!
