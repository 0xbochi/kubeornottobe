# Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** based in **New York**, deeply passionate about **Kubernetes, DevOps, and Cloud Computing**.  

## My Journey  

I started my career as a **Linux enthusiast**, tinkering with servers, optimizing infrastructure, and automating everything I could. Over time, I delved into **Kubernetes, Terraform, and cloud platforms like AWS**, refining my skills in container orchestration, automation, and infrastructure as code.  

Today, I specialize in **Kubernetes, networking, and Linux internals**, aiming to **contribute to open-source projects**.

## Why This Blog?  

I created **KubeOrNotToBe** to share insights, best practices, and real-world experiences from the trenches. Whether it's **debugging Kubernetes issues**, **CI/CD pipelines**, or **exploring new DevOps tools**, you'll find practical content here.

And most importantly: **Sharing is caring**! If you see any possible improvements, don‚Äôt hesitate! I‚Äôm in constant learning mode and open to any advice! If we can help each other, it would be a pleasure! It also goes both ways‚Äîif you need any advice or anything else, feel free to ask!


Some topics I love to cover:
- **Kubernetes deep dives** (controllers, operators, networking, and security)
- **Cloud-native tooling** (Helm, Terraform, Ansible)
- **SRE methodologies** (incident management, observability, and chaos engineering)
- **DevOps automation** (GitOps, CI/CD, and IaC)
- **Hacking and security** (CKS preparation, securing clusters, pentesting cloud environments)
